# Expense Tracker

The Expense Tracker is a simple Java console-based application that allows users to track and manage their expenses. Users can add new expenses, view the list of expenses, and calculate the total expense.

## Project Structure

### 1. `Expense.java`

- Represents the `Expense` class with attributes such as category, amount, date, and description.
- Provides a constructor and getter methods.

### 2. `ExpenseTracker.java`

- Represents the `ExpenseTracker` class managing an expense tracker by storing a list of expenses.
- Provides methods to add expenses, display all expenses, and calculate the total expense.
- Implements the user interface for the Expense Tracker.

## How to Run

1. Save each class in separate `.java` files (e.g., `Expense.java`, `ExpenseTracker.java`).
2. Compile the classes using the `javac` command:
    
    ```bash
    javac Expense.java ExpenseTracker.java
    
    ```
    
3. Run the program:
    
    ```bash
    java ExpenseTracker
    
    ```
    

## Usage

1. Choose options from the menu to add expenses, view expenses, calculate the total expense, or exit the system.
2. Follow the prompts to input expense details or select options.
3. The system provides feedback on successful operations.

## Customization

Feel free to customize and expand upon this project based on your requirements. You can add features like data persistence (saving to a file), graphical user interface (GUI), and more sophisticated expense tracking capabilities.
